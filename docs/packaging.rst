Managed and Unlocked Packaging
------------------------------

CumulusCI makes it easy to build first- and second-generation managed packages, as well as Unlocked Packages.
While the overall workflows for all types of packages are quite similar, there are key differences between them.
The chapters below explore all three packaging options.

New projects should, absent any other considerations, generally choose to use second-generation managed packages or
Unlocked Packages.
